# Pollinators Activity

This activity is for the purposes of evaluating web design/development candidates. While this scenario is fictional, it includes plausible, real content to showcase the practical application of good design principles.

## Project Scenario and Description

You’ve been asked to design a **single web page** for a new initiative highlighting the importance of pollinators like birds, bees, and other insects. The main goals of this page are to:

- generate interest in the topic, and
- motivate site visitors to sign up for an email mailing list to learn more.

Don't worry; the page’s text content and a library of images you can use are provided. Please be as creative as you would like in presenting this information and implementing the design.

- The overall tone and feel should be informative, engaging, hopeful, and inspiring.
- The primary audience for this page is U.S. adults with at least a high school education.
- Feel free to use web fonts, CSS/JS frameworks, stock photography, design elements, or any other resources that you feel are appropriate.
- Content layout, fonts, colors, and any other design choices are up to you.

## Instructions and Submission

2. Edit index.html and other files as needed to implement your design.
3. Submit a zip file of your work.

Please submit your work to Chris Komlenic via email at cxk292@psu.edu. For the purposes of this activity, please write and send this email with your submission in the same way you would if you were sharing work with a client or stakeholder. 

Your index.html file should open in a web browser, and any linked resources (CSS, JS, images, libraries, etc.) should load correctly on a computer with an internet connection.
