# Buzzing with Life: Discover the Power of Pollinators

## Why pollinators matter

Pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, and birds, play a crucial role in the reproduction of flowering plants. This essential ecological service ensures the biodiversity of plant species, sustains ecosystems, and supports the global food supply by enabling the growth of many fruits, vegetables, and nuts.

(Statistics to display)

- +80% of plants use pollinators to reproduce
- 1 of 3 bites of food we eat exists because of pollinators
- 3/4 of the world’s major food crops benefit from pollinators

## Threats to pollinators

Habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change threaten pollinator populations, potentially disrupting food webs, nutrient cycling, and biodiversity. Protecting these critical players is crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems and sustainable food production.

## Research spotlight

Pollinator research helps us to understand their behavior, genetics, and responses to environmental changes, informing effective conservation measures and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
